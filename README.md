IMP:- i tried making a full stack version of this using MERN, it is somewhat working after the API tests done in postman, but theres some issue with the UI of the website so it was not 100% ready.
      as i am just beginner in backend tech so i am having difficulty in finding out the error and sorting it currently. In future i will try my best to sort out the error and implement the full stack version
